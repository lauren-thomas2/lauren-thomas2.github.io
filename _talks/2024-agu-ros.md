Rain-on-snow (ROS) is becoming common across historically snow-dominated watersheds as winters become warmer and precipitation increases. In the Arctic and sub-Arctic, these events can have catastrophic consequences, including wildlife die-offs, hazardous transportation conditions, and food shortages. Further, ROS may significantly impact snowpack characteristics and accelerate permafrost thaw, releasing large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. Despite the consequences of ROS, these events remain difficult to detect with remote sensing and sparse networks of in situ sensors and meteorological stations, making understanding the links between ROS, snowpack, subsurface temperatures, and permafrost a challenge in high latitude regions of the globe. We present a case study using field observations and data from water year 2022 ROS events on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. We find that these events can be detected in a network of snow-ground interface temperature sensors, where relationships are seen in the timing of periods of phase change at the base of the snowpack following ROS events. We validate our method using precipitation and air temperature measurements from a local meteorological station and ERA5-Land Reanalysis data. Further, we describe some of the impacts these events may have on the thermal regime within Alaskan systems, at both the snow-ground interface and in the subsurface, so that impacts of ROS in a changing Arctic can be better understood and monitored.
